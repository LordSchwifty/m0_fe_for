# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I am comfortable with the setup and knowing how it works. I am struggling with finding answers to my
questions on google.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? I felt like it was quite the struggle to find the answers. But the struggle was definitely productive.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to beef up my notes a bit. Revisit some of the assignments again and work through them a second
time I think would be beneficial.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I understand how to do everything. But I need to be able to do them by heart I think.
